📝 Project Title: Calorie Tracker Web Application
📄 Project Description:

The Calorie Tracker Web Application is a simple and responsive web-based tool that helps users track their daily calorie intake based on the food items they consume. Users can enter the name of the food and its quantity (in grams), and the app calculates and displays the corresponding calorie content using a backend API connected to an Oracle database. The application also maintains a daily log and shows the total calorie count for the day.

This project integrates a clean HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend with a Node.js + Express backend API and uses Oracle SQL (via SQL*Plus) to manage and query nutritional data. It offers a practical use case for combining front-end development, API interaction, and SQL database management.
